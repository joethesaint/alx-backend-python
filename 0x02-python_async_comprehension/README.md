This project contains tasks for learning to use asynchronous comprehensions in python 3.

## Tasks to Complete

+ [x] 0. **Async Generator**<br/>[1-async_genertaor.py](0-async_generator.py) contains an asynchronous coroutine called `asyn_generator` that takes no arguments and meets the following requiremnets:
    + Coroutine will loop 10 time asynchronously wait 1 second, then yield a random number between 0 and 10.
    + Use the `random` module.
